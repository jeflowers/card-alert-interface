# Card Alert Interface - System Architecture

## Overview

The Card Alert Interface is a comprehensive fraud analytics system designed to detect, process, and manage suspicious card transactions efficiently. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, including UML diagrams, flow designs, and data models that represent the system's structure and behavior.

The system architecture diagram above illustrates the four key processes of the Card Alert Interface system:

1. **Data Collection** - Continuously monitors transaction data from multiple payment sources in real-time
2. **Analysis & Detection** - AI algorithms analyze transaction patterns against known fraud signatures and anomaly detection models
3. **Alert Generation** - When suspicious activity is detected, the system generates targeted alerts with risk assessment
4. **Response & Feedback** - System operators review alerts, take appropriate actions, and provide feedback to improve detection accuracy

## Architecture Diagrams

The following diagrams represent different perspectives on the system architecture:

1. [UML Class Diagram](diagrams/uml-class-diagram.md) - Shows the object-oriented structure of the system, core entities, and their relationships
2. [System Flow Design](diagrams/system-flow-design.md) - Details the end-to-end process flow for alert handling and case management
3. [Activity Diagram](diagrams/system-activity-diagram.md) - Illustrates the business process activities and their relationships
4. [Data Flow Diagram](diagrams/data-flow-diagram.md) - Depicts how data moves through the system, including integration points

## Design Principles

The Card Alert Interface architecture follows these key design principles:

- **Modularity**: The system is divided into separate components (alerts, cases, card actions) that can be developed and maintained independently
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear distinction between UI, business logic, and data access layers
- **Security-first approach**: Security considerations are built into the design at all levels
- **Scalability**: The architecture supports horizontal scaling of application servers and database resources

## Components

### Frontend Layer
The user interface is built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, organized into functional modules:
- Alert Management Interface
- Case Management Interface
- Card Block & Reissue Interface

### Application Layer
The backend consists of Node.js services with Express.js providing RESTful API endpoints:
- Alert Services
- Case Services
- Card Management Services

### Data Layer
The system uses an Oracle Database with the following schema groups:
- Fraud Alert Tables
- Case Management Tables
- Hotlist Tables

## Integration Points

The Card Alert Interface integrates with:
- External fraud detection systems (inbound)
- Card processing systems (outbound)
- Customer notification systems

## Security Architecture

The system implements security at multiple levels:
- Authentication and authorization controls
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Secure communications via HTTPS
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Deployment Architecture

The production deployment architecture includes:
- Multiple load-balanced application servers
- Primary and standby database instances
- Disaster recovery provisions
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
